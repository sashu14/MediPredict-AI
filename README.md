MediPredict AI is a production-ready Disease Prediction System that analyzes user symptoms using multiple Machine Learning models to provide a highly accurate diagnosis, detailed descriptions, and recommended precautions.

## ✨ Features
- **3-Model Ensemble**: Predictions from Random Forest (Primary), Naive Bayes, and SVM.
- **Dynamic UI**: Beautiful dark medical theme with animations.
- **Multi-select Symptoms**: Easy selection from 132+ symptoms with autocomplete.
- **Detailed Analytics**: Confidence scores, model agreement indicators, and risk level assessment.
- **PDF Report**: Download a professional medical report of your results.
- **Disease Catalog**: Information on all 41 diseases the system can predict.

## ⚠️ MEDICAL DISCLAIMER
**IMPORTANT:** This tool is for educational purposes only. Always consult a certified medical professional. The predictions provided by this AI should not be taken as a final medical diagnosis.
